## Description:  
This repository contains implementations of motif search algorithms, including:  
- **Branch and Bound**: An exact algorithm for finding optimal motifs efficiently.  
- **Gibbs Sampling**: A probabilistic algorithm for motif discovery in biological sequences.  

These algorithms are commonly used in bioinformatics to identify conserved patterns in DNA sequences.
